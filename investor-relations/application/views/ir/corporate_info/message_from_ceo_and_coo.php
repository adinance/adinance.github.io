            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2022 was my first year of management, working collectively with Khun Kitti and a new management team to lead the CMO into the future by restructuring the business into an Experience-Tech Creator in order to build the best possible experience with technology and use technology to bring customers to new experiences. The business is divided into 4 categories, namely Event, Equipment & Production, Entertainment and Technology. Throughout the past year, I, Khun Kitti, and the management team have been steadfastly working to manage and grow the CMO company, which has resulted in changes in a variety of fascinating dimensions, including the following:</p>
            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Increase the potential of the business by opening CM Live Co., Ltd. to penetrate the full entertainment business, including Korean,
            Thai and international concerts, including other entertainment businesses. We started the first project with GOT7 “'HOMECOMING' 2022 FANCON”, a world-class K POP organized as a Live Show in South Korea, ready to broadcast online worldwide and held a concert “Annyeong Bangkok Arena K 2022”, a concert that combined Thai and Korean artists on the same stage with more than 14,000 fans crowding the hall. And in 2023, we have a plan to penetrate the entertainment market in Asia and South East Asia, which will be the year that people will see more clarity of the CMO in the form of an entertainment agency.</p>
            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In terms of earnings, it had been a year that CMO had continued to grow, especially in the second quarter, which was considered a leap growth. It was a truly turnaround year under the management of the new shareholder structure, turning around to profit for the first time in three years. However, although the consolidated financial statements for the year 2022 still have a net loss, it is a much lower loss, which from various plans in 2023 and the determination of the management team and all employees, we strongly believe that the Company will continue to have the better direction.</p>
            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Company has studied to expand the business in Digital and Technology Solutions by studying from all 6 companies. There is a possibility that Transformational Co., Ltd. and us will work together in a new business.  If there is any clarity in the various agreements, the Company will inform the SET further. As for the expansion of work in the Technology group, it takes time to study thoroughly, which I, Khun Kitti and the management team will jointly push the CMO to move into the technology business quickly and efficiently to create a complete solution for new and existing customers of CMO. We must be trusted by our customers to help organizations and 
            brands with a vision of the future, transforming into the business in web 3.0 world.</p>
            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the year 2023, the Company is looking for business opportunities, aiming to expand entertainment in Asia and South East Asia as it is a large market and expanding rapidly, such as in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand, by starting the first event in January 2023, opening the Malaysian market, and organizing a concert festival for Korean artists, SEEN FESTIVAL, in Kuala Lumpur 2023. Over 10,000 people attended the event, which was a good start for an international event. At the same time, there will be a merger and acquisition (M&A) plan that will help to increase the Company's potential rapidly, which will be in business groups related to the Company's operations.</p>
            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On this occasion, I would like to thank our customers, partners, and shareholders who have consistently supported and believed in the Company's business operations, as well as thank all employees for their commitment to their hard work. This is on behalf of management and all employees. I would like to urge everyone to have faith that I, along with the management team, will lead the business to consistently grow revenue, foster transparency, and build a reputation as the market leader.</p>
