<div>
</div><div>CMO Group Public Company Limited focuses on the importance of risk management. Thus, a risk management system is applied in the Company by reference to the framework of COSO (The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission), which is the International Standard. The Board of Directors has assigned the Audit Committee to review the Company’s performance to efficiently and effectively organize and manage risk. The Internal Audit Department is responsible for inspecting to ensure that the operational department has an adequate internal risk management system and reporting to the Audit Committee. In addition, the Internal Audit Department also provides consultations to auditees and communicates feedback for further improvement. Monthly, the Company had a management meeting on risk management among business units to prepare to handle and prevent any risk that may occur.
</div><div>
</div><div>However, the Company has a policy to support internal and external anti-corruption within the organization and establish a code of conduct for business partners. Moreover, the Company has assigned the management to study anti-corruption compliance programs and also provide channels of whistleblowing or complaints.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>1. Risk Management</strong></div><br><div><strong>
</strong></div><div>
</div><div>Risk Factors for the Company’s Business Operation</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>1.1 Risk for the Company’s Business Operation</strong></div><br><div><strong>
</strong></div><div>
</div><div><strong>1.1.1 Risk from Social, Economic Instability and the Change of Government Policy</strong></div><br><div><strong>
</strong></div><div>
</div><div>Event Management is connected to and related to advertisement and public relations business that directly ties in with the country's overall economic situation. Public spending and general business survival are essential factors for product or service owners in considering any advertisement or public relations, which include exhibitions as a marketing tool for sales promotion.
</div><div>
</div><div>When people in the country, ranging from business sectors at the level of consumer product operators to the high impact level such as energy, are substantially sensitive to the political situation. Therefore, the business operation is directly affected by overall political and economic movements such as political stability, political protest, and monetary policy. These factors affect the consideration of roles of advertising, public relations, and budget for organizing event activities, not to mention various project policies established and supported directly by the government and jointly promoted by the private sector. Examples are gigantic projects of event organizations, such as the country’s public relations projects for tourism purposes or international conferences. It may be changing the projects’ policy to conform with current circumstances.
</div><div>
</div><div>Nevertheless, the Company has always been well-prepared for such cases. The Company attempts to allocate the management to avoid over-reliance on certain parties from the government or private sector. The company revenue comes from different customers, not depending on or influenced by any customer. It also tries to balance income-generating operations with maximum prudence, from establishing the policy to relying on its work. Recently, Thailand has been the Center of an International Conference. This cause gave the Company get opportunities to organize International Conference projects. Also, the Company aims to get more revenue from these opportunities. So, the Company has set up a new International Meeting and Conference business. Moreover, Company has CLMV's policy to expand the business to CLMV's and ASEAN countries by using Company's advantages and strong points.
</div><div>
</div><div>In addition, over the past three years, Thailand's economy and the world have been significantly affected by the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Economic activities were directly affected, especially tourism, due to the measures to limit traveling into and out of the country. On the other hand, domestic consumption also shrunk. However, the Company was well aware of the risks, as mentioned earlier, thereby conducting an initial risk evaluation and setting the operating cost management policy to reduce overall expenses to maintain the cash flow of the Company able to continue the business.</div></h3>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>1.1.2 Emerging Risks from Changing that may affect the Company's Business Operations in the next 3-5 years and advances in Technology</strong><strong><br></strong><br><strong>
</strong><div>
</div><div>An advantage of today’s technology is beyond bounder. Trends or lifestyles in the west end can cross or share via the internet to be popular on another side of the continent overnight. All of these can happen because of the advantage of technology, which changes very fast. According to COVID-19, the pandemic will become an accelerator that drives trends that once were believed would take years to rise. Then, creating a new consumer experience cannot be used traditional way anymore. The company always combines trends and technology in company events to deliver clients’ experiences.
</div><div>
</div><div>The company has developed and encouraged the quality of events to go even further. With the exposure to new technologies corresponding to the event, there is a team to take care of customers and give advice closely. Ready to create quality events from new perspectives. They are always beneficial to the business of the customer's company, such as finding new marketing tools or creating cooperation with the owner of that technology. To work together and transfer knowledge that helps strengthen the company's business units continually.
</div><div>
</div><div>In addition to events, the company plans to deal with technological changes. By studying the establishment of a business unit specializing in technology to design, develop and bring technology currently available. To provide services in various fields to strengthen customers' confidence that they receive efficient and modern services at all times. Including different application development plans that will be able to meet the needs of all groups of customers shortly.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>1.1.3 Risk from Uncertainty of the Customer Marketing Plan and Changing Consumer Behavior.</strong></div><br><div>The world has been rapidly changing over the past three years due to The COVID-19 pandemic. Without any doubt, it significantly impacts household consumption and business operation. COVID-1 9 also results in the cessation of on-ground events, which is an efficient tool of marketing to penetrate the target customer of each product or service. Consequently, the Company and our affiliations could be easily affected by the risk of changing the customer marketing plan. COVID-19 will change consumer behavior to be more internet-based. Nowadays, Online platform is taking an important role and also rapidly growing. Therefore, the company has developed both online and hybrid Events to meet customer needs. As a result, our live-streaming studio has been constructed to launch online events and a new virtual experience. These can make our clients easily reach their customers.
</div><div>
</div><div>Moreover, since the Company has been in the business continuously for over three decades, it has a customer base comprising both government and private sectors conducting various types of business, which has a different period of setting events in a year. These could help Company to minimize the risk. Moreover, Company also has a policy to reach new clients in all parts of industries, such as Museum management and construction, which is getting fewer effects from the pandemic, for revenue growth and palliative effect when key accounts abstain from an event. The company has a business unit to care for and closely provide customer services. To embrace all opinions and truly understand the purpose of using customers' budgets. And to evaluate the efficiency of the work that provides services to customers in order to provide high-quality work and achieve maximum satisfaction. It can continue to expand the business continuously.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>1.1.4 Risk from Changing in Operating Industry</strong></div><br><div><strong>
</strong></div><div>
</div><div>Nowadays, the Event Management market has become well-known and has increased market value yearly, not to mention its attractive revenue. Therefore, many operators, including those previously related to the business, which are advertising agencies, media, television programs, and public relations companies, begin to adjust them and find ways to create more revenue from the event management market. These operators attempt to focus on their existing strengths, as well as to incorporate the business of event management into their operations. However, despite the attempt to create more selling points to increase revenue, expertise in event management depends on experience and specific skills. Although these companies try to establish an Event Management division or use other marketing methods to decrease their cost, the expertise of existing personnel still needs to respond to the client's needs. Moreover, they cannot organize the events with equitable standards compared to companies with direct experience in this field. Nevertheless, the growth trend of these companies in the event market still creates pressure and results in more aggressive competition in the industry.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Additionally, the event market involves the movement of previous operators or clients who have accumulated experience and learned about event management from our Company or other event management companies. Therefore, these operators or clients can adjust themselves and learn to organize the events without depending upon direct event management companies in some cases. Thus, the Event industry not only confronts higher competition but also needs to adjust, maintain, and improve its quality. At the same time, it is also necessary to obtain client acceptance from successful performance and to continuously develop its potential to the greatest extent.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>The Company has developed and encouraged the quality of event management by accepting new technology suitable for organizing events. Our staff are assigned to take good care of the clients closely and can create high-quality events with new concepts that are always beneficial for the business of the Company. Examples include finding joint ventures to enhance the Company's potential or finding new marketing tools to reinforce the business units continuously. Moreover, the Company takes advantage of the Company's strength by expanding the business into the potential international market to reduce the risks.

</strong></div><div>
</div><div>The Company attaches great importance to personnel because Event management is a service that uses personnel as the main factor in business operations. That's why the Company could risk losing skilled personnel to competitors in the same industry or customers who need personnel to organize events in-house. Therefore, the Company attempted to reduce such risk by developing associates' abilities and skills and promoting all levels for mutual benefit. Furthermore, the Company paid attention to associates, providing them with good welfare, arranged various projects to build their happiness and job stability, and created good engagement between associates.

Moreover, if there are many participants, insurance will be provided to reduce the burden of liability in the event of an accident.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>1.1.7 Risk of Natural Disasters</strong></div><br><div><strong>
</strong></div><div>
</div><div>Nowadays, the environment and climate are changing and challenging to forecast. Natural disasters occur more often than in the past, which may affect the Company’s business. The event might have to postpone avoiding these disasters.
