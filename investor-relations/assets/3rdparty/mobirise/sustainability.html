                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style align-center display-4">Event Management is connected to and related to advertisement and public relations
business that directly ties in with the country's overall economic situation. Public spending
and general business survival are essential factors for product or service owners in
considering any advertisement or public relations, which include exhibitions as a marketing
tool for sales promotion.<br><br>
When people in the country, ranging from business sectors at the level of consumer
product operators to the high impact level such as energy, are substantially sensitive to the
political situation. Therefore, the business operation is directly affected by overall political and
economic movements such as political stability, political protest, and monetary policy. These
factors affect the consideration of roles of advertising, public relations, and budget for
organizing event activities, not to mention various project policies established and
supported directly by the government and jointly promoted by the private sector. Examples
are gigantic projects of event organizations, such as the country’s public relations projects for
tourism purposes or international conferences. It may be changing the projects’ policy to
conform with current circumstances.<br><br>
Nevertheless, the Company has always been well-prepared for such cases. The Company
attempts to allocate the management to avoid over-reliance on certain parties from the
government or private sector. The company revenue comes from different customers, not
depending on or influenced by any customer. It also tries to balance income-generating
operations with maximum prudence, from establishing the policy to relying on its work.
Recently, Thailand has been the Center of an International Conference. This cause gave the
Company get opportunities to organize International Conference projects. Also, the
Company aims to get more revenue from these opportunities. So, the Company has set up a
new International Meeting and Conference business. Moreover, Company has CLMV's policy
to expand the business to CLMV's and ASEAN countries by using Company's
advantages and strong points.<br><br>
In addition, over the past three years, Thailand's economy and the world have been
significantly affected by the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Economic activities were
directly affected, especially tourism, due to the measures to limit traveling into and out of the
country. On the other hand, domestic consumption also shrunk. However, the Company was
well aware of the risks, as mentioned earlier, thereby conducting an initial risk evaluation and
setting the operating cost management policy to reduce overall expenses to maintain the
cash flow of the Company able to continue the business.<br><br></p>

All of these can happen because of the advantage of technology, which changes very fast.
According to COVID-19, the pandemic will become an accelerator that drives trends that once

                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style align-center display-4">The world has been rapidly changing over the past three years due to The COVID-19
pandemic. Without any doubt, it significantly impacts household consumption and business
operation. COVID-1 9 also results in the cessation of on-ground events, which is an efficient
tool of marketing to penetrate the target customer of each product or service. Consequently,
the Company and our affiliations could be easily affected by the risk of changing the
customer marketing plan. COVID-19 will change consumer behavior to be more
internet-based. Nowadays, Online platform is taking an important role and also rapidly
growing. Therefore, the company has developed both online and hybrid Events to meet
customer needs. As a result, our live-streaming studio has been constructed to launch online
events and a new virtual experience. These can make our clients easily reach their
customers.<br><br>
Moreover, since the Company has been in the business continuously for over three decades,
it has a customer base comprising both government and private sectors conducting various
types of business, which has a different period of setting events in a year. These could help
Company to minimize the risk. Moreover, Company also has a policy to reach new clients in
all parts of industries, such as Museum management and construction, which is getting
fewer effects from the pandemic, for revenue growth and palliative effect when key accounts
abstain from an event. The company has a business unit to care for and closely provide
customer services. To embrace all opinions and truly understand the purpose of using
customers' budgets. And to evaluate the efficiency of the work that provides services

                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style align-center display-4">Nowadays, the Event Management market has become well-known and has increased
market value yearly, not to mention its attractive revenue. Therefore, many operators,
including those previously related to the business, which are advertising agencies, media,
television programs, and public relations companies, begin to adjust them and find ways to
create more revenue from the event management market. These operators attempt to focus
on their existing strengths, as well as to incorporate the business of event management into
their operations. However, despite the attempt to create more selling points to increase
revenue, expertise in event management depends on experience and specific skills.
Although these companies try to establish an Event Management division or use other
marketing methods to decrease their cost, the expertise of existing personnel still needs to
respond to the client's needs. Moreover, they cannot organize the events with equitable
standards compared to companies with direct experience in this field. Nevertheless, the
growth trend of these companies in the event market still creates pressure and results in
more aggressive competition in the industry.<br><br>
Additionally, the event market involves the movement of previous operators or clients who
have accumulated experience and learned about event management from our Company or
other event management companies. Therefore, these operators or clients can adjust
themselves and learn to organize the events without depending upon direct event
management companies in some cases. Thus, the Event industry not only confronts higher
competition but also needs to adjust, maintain, and improve its quality. At the same time, it is
also necessary to obtain client acceptance from successful performance and to continuously
develop its potential to the greatest extent.<br><br>
The Company has developed and encouraged the quality of event management by
accepting new technology suitable for organizing events. Our staff are assigned to take good
care of the clients closely and can create high-quality events with new concepts that are
always beneficial for the business of the Company. Examples include finding joint ventures to
enhance the Company's potential or finding new marketing tools to reinforce the business
units continuously. Moreover, the Company takes advantage of the Company's strength by
expanding the business into the potential international market to reduce the risks.<br><br></p>
